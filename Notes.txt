Beat Tracker
Rhythm Manager
	Song:
		3 minutes
		180 seconds
		120 bpm
		2 bps
		How many beats?
		bps * seconds = ***360 beats***
	How to populate array?
		iterator  = i
		beatValue = b
		Starting at i == 0 and b == 0,
			i++
			b = b + 

Need a better way to queue up notes:
Attempt 1:
	Define a new variable: queueAdvance
		Defines how far in advance a note can be attempted (roughly 2x as long as note forgiveness?)
		Misclicking outside of this window will do nothing (or maybe incur some sort of penalty? stun?)
		Misclicking inside this window will miss the upcoming note
